# FastMCP-Ollama Project Plan

## Overview
Advanced MCP server for Ollama integration using FastMCP framework, providing enhanced functionality over the reference implementation.

## Epics

### Epic 1: Project Foundation
**Objective**: Establish solid project structure and core architecture.

**Stories**:
- Set up modular project structure with proper Python packaging
- Implement configuration management with Pydantic
- Create utility functions for common operations
- Set up development environment with linting, testing, and type checking

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Project installs correctly with `pip install -e .`
- Configuration loads from environment variables
- Code passes linting and type checking
- Basic utility functions work correctly

### Epic 2: Core MVP Implementation
**Objective**: Implement essential MCP tools for basic Ollama functionality.

**Stories**:
- Model Management: list, show, pull, remove models
- Chat Functionality: basic chat, streaming chat, default model chat
- Completion Generation: text completion with various options
- Configuration Tools: get config, get default model

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All 10 core tools function correctly
- Server runs without errors
- Tools integrate properly with FastMCP framework
- Error handling works for invalid inputs

### Epic 3: Quality Assurance
**Objective**: Ensure code quality and reliability.

**Stories**:
- Comprehensive unit tests for all modules
- Integration tests for tool functionality
- Code coverage reporting
- Documentation and examples

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Test suite passes with good coverage
- Code is well-documented
- README provides clear usage instructions
- Examples demonstrate key functionality

### Epic 4: Production Readiness
**Objective**: Prepare for production deployment.

**Stories**:
- Docker containerization
- Health checks and monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Application runs in Docker
- Health endpoints work correctly
- Performance meets requirements
- Security best practices implemented

None currently

### ðŸ“‹ Backlog (Phase 2+)
- Enhanced multimodal support (vision, images)
- Embedding generation tools
- Model fine-tuning capabilities
- Advanced conversation management
- Plugin system for custom tools
- Web-based management interface

## Technical Architecture

### Core Modules
- `config.py` - Configuration management with Pydantic
- `utils.py` - Utility functions (retry, validation, formatting)
- `server.py` - Main FastMCP server with tool definitions
- `tools/` - Modular tool implementations
  - `models.py` - Model management operations
  - `chat.py` - Chat and completion functionality

### Key Features
- **10 MCP Tools** vs 5 in reference implementation
- **Modular Design** for easy extension
- **Robust Error Handling** with retry mechanisms
- **Streaming Support** for real-time responses
- **Comprehensive Testing** with pytest
- **Production Ready** configuration management

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria
- [x] Server starts without errors
- [x] All tools respond to MCP requests
- [x] Configuration loads correctly
- [x] Tests pass
- [x] Documentation is complete

### Quality Metrics
- [x] Code coverage > 80%
- [x] All linters pass
- [x] Type checking passes
- [x] Documentation coverage

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Ollama API Changes**: Mitigated by using official Python client
- **FastMCP Framework Maturity**: Mitigated by following official patterns
- **Python Version Compatibility**: Mitigated by testing on multiple versions

### Implementation Risks
- **Tool Complexity**: Mitigated by starting with simple implementations
- **Error Handling**: Mitigated by comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Testing Coverage**: Mitigated by unit tests for all functions

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Connection pooling for multiple Ollama instances
- Caching for frequently accessed models
- Async optimization for concurrent requests

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for custom tools
- Configuration hot-reloading
- Multiple transport support (not just stdio)

### Maintenance
- Automated dependency updates
- Security scanning
- Performance monitoring
